I have successfully completed Task 1, which involved building a Spring Boot-based ticket booking system with a Thymeleaf frontend. Users can select their start and end stations, get the fare calculated automatically, and generate a unique ticket ID upon purchase. The system ensures that each ticket can only be used once for entry and once for exit. All ticket data is securely stored in a MySQL database. You can test the working of this application using the JAR file through the following URLs:

Home → http://localhost:8080/

Mark Entry → /enter?ticketId=<your-ticket-id>
